    I was lucky to have the chance to travel around the world for half of 2024.
    This was my first experience solo-traveling and I loved the freedom and
    independence that came with having no set plan and everthing I needed in my
    suitcase. I visited 13 countries - all of which were brand new destinations
    for me!

    One of my favorite memories from my time in Europe was taking midnight hikes
    in Norway (above the Arctice Circle!).

    I became a Register Yoga Instructor in Ubud, Bali. The training was 200
    hours of yoga flows, workshops, biology, anatomy, and history. I am so
    grateful to have met so many amazing friends through this transformative
    experience.
