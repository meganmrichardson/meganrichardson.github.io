    I was lucky to have the chance to travel around the world for half of 2024.
    This was my first experience solo-traveling and I loved the freedom and
    independence that came with having no set plan and everthing I needed in my
    suitcase. I visited 13 countries - all of which were brand new destinations
    for me!

    One of my favorite memories from my time in Europe was going on midnight
    hikes in Norway. I visited the Lofoten Islands, way North of the Arctice
    Circle! It is the most magical place I have ever traveled too and would
    recommend visiting if you've never experienced Northen Scandanavia.

    I became a Register Yoga Instructor in Ubud, Bali. The training was 200
    hours of yoga flows, workshops, and lessons. Our lession were explorations
    of anatomy and history of yoga. I am so grateful to have met so many amazing
    friends through this transformative experience.
