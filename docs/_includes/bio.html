  Lately, I've been excited about:
</p>
<ul class="paragraph">
  <li style="margin-bottom: 20px">
    Books. My reading goal for 2025 is 30 books (one more than I read in 2024).
    I've recently expanded my list of genres to include non-fiction. Please send
    over your favorite reads!
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 20px">
    Board games. My current favorite is Wingspan - I highly recommend if you are
    also a board game lover.
  </li>
  <li>Printmaking. I've been carving linocut prints in my free time.</li>
</ul>
