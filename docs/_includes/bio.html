  Lately, I've been excited about:
  <ul>
    <li>Books. My reading goal for 2025 is 30 books (1 more than I read in 2024)! I've recently expanded my list of genres to include non-fiction.</li>
    <li>Board games. My current favorite is Wingspan - I highly recommend if you are also a board game lover.</li>
    <li>Crafting. I've been carving linocut prints and making beaded necklaces for my friends.</li>
  </ul>
