    I spent two years in NYC - living in SoHo and communting to the Financial
    District every day. I worked as a software engineer at Goldman Sachs,
    developing end-to-end features on Marquee Portfolio Analytics team.

    One of my favorite spots in the city is Central Park. Nothing beats walking
    around the park on an Autumn morning.
